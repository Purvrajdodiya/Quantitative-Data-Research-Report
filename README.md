The assignment is a research-like report in APA style. You are expected to write:
A BRIEF introduction outlining the rationale for your hypotheses (10% of marks). You can rely on common sense, no previous theoretical background in relation to the data set is needed. 
A methods section detailing which analyses were chosen to address your hypotheses along with appropriate justification (20% of marks).
A clear results section outlining up to 4 separate analyses (50% of marks).
A discussion of the appropriate interpretation and conclusions of your results (20% of marks).

The clearer, more sensible and better structured your report, the better the mark. If you report very simple analyses and results, the mark will not be high. If you report more complicated analyses, providing a better explanation of the data, your mark will likely be higher. If you just include nonsense in your results, the mark will be low. It is important that you make the most of the data you have, giving the best explanations you can provide.
